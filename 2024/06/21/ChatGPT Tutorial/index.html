<p>Everyone says that AI is powerful and can greatly change our lives and work, but in reality, getting started is not as hard as you might think. The key is finding the right way to begin.</p>
<p>This article will help you understand the basics of using ChatGPT, including the registration process, prompt writing, and more.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p><strong>How to Register for ChatGPT for Free</strong></p>
<p>Visit the ChatGPT official website (<a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://chat.openai.com</a>) and click the “Sign up” button. You can choose to register with an email address; using a Google email is recommended.</p>
<p>You can also choose to log in directly through Google, Microsoft, or Apple accounts.</p>
<p>If you register with an email, the system will prompt you to set a password, which must be at least 12 characters long.</p>
<p><img src="https://adx-static.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/img/202407271907302.jpeg" alt></p>
<p>After completing the registration, you will receive an email with a link to verify your email address. Afterward, the system might ask for additional information, such as your full name and date of birth.</p>
<p><img src="https://adx-static.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/img/202407271907304.jpeg" alt></p>
<p>Once these steps are completed, you will have successfully registered!</p>

<p>Log in to ChatGPT, and at the bottom of the main interface, you will find an input box where you can start conversing with the AI.</p>
<p><img src="https://adx-static.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/img/202407271907305.jpeg" alt></p>
<p>So, what should we do after registering for ChatGPT? Here are some usage tips…</p>
<p><strong>How to Use ChatGPT</strong></p>
<p>When you start using ChatGPT or other AI platforms, you will often come across the term “prompt.” A prompt is essentially a command you give the AI, telling it what you want it to help you with.</p>
<p>For example, “write a script to process data,” and it will immediately generate a script for you.</p>
<p><img src="https://adx-static.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/img/202407271907306.png" alt></p>
<p>However, if you use a more specific prompt, such as “write a detailed document explaining a new feature: write a Python script to read data from a CSV file, filter out rows with missing values, and output the results to a new CSV file, ensuring the script can handle more than 10,000 rows of data and run on both Windows and Linux systems,” you will get content that better meets your needs.</p>
<p><img src="https://adx-static.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/img/202407271907307.jpeg" alt></p>
<p>You can write your own prompts as needed or use prompts written by others.</p>
<p>When writing your own prompts, it is crucial to be clear about what you want ChatGPT to accomplish. Using directive verbs such as “write,” “explain,” “create,” etc., can make your commands more precise. The clearer your instructions, the more likely you are to get results that meet your expectations.</p>
<p>Additionally, providing enough context information is key. As mentioned earlier, a vague instruction might yield a script, but it might not meet your specific needs.</p>
<p>Make sure you specify what you want ChatGPT to include (or exclude). For example, if you don’t want your script to include date data, make sure to state that clearly.</p>
<p>When interacting with ChatGPT, expressing your true feelings or problems can help you get better answers.</p>
<p>For example, saying “this issue is really important for my work” or “I really need an accurate answer this time” can help ChatGPT better understand your needs and provide more satisfactory answers.</p>
<p>If you get an answer from ChatGPT that you like but it’s not perfect, you don’t need to start over.</p>
<p>Simply tell the AI what went wrong, and it will try again, considering your corrections. Something like “Can you rewrite the above content, but this time only use 12 lines instead of 16?”</p>
<p>Providing ChatGPT with more information about yourself can also help you get more targeted answers.</p>
<p>Note: Do not provide personal privacy information, such as when using it to help write an email. Telling ChatGPT you are a project manager can help it provide more focused and accurate responses.</p>
<p>In fact, you can provide ChatGPT with some detailed information about yourself in advance, so it can make personalized adjustments when answering your questions each time.</p>
<p>To do this, visit the “Customize ChatGPT” option by clicking on the personal information icon in the bottom left corner of the page. Here, you can add information about yourself and customize how you want the platform to respond.</p>
<p>For example, if you are a student, you can fill in “I am a diligent college student majoring in English” in the first box of the customization description and add “Always reply in a formal academic writing style and provide detailed explanations, avoiding unnecessary wording” in the second box.</p>
<p><img src="https://adx-static.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/img/202407271907308.jpeg" alt></p>
<p><strong>How to Manage How ChatGPT Uses Your Data</strong></p>
<p>ChatGPT reminds users not to share too much personal information. This is good advice for using any AI tool, but especially important when using ChatGPT.</p>
<p>You should never share personal data, sensitive company information, or password information with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>This year, OpenAI introduced a memory feature for ChatGPT, which is not yet available to all users.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this feature allows the tool to remember information about you for future use.</p>
<p>If you are uncomfortable with this, you can choose to turn it off. Go to “Settings” &gt; “Personalization” &gt; “Manage Memory,” where you can view and delete specific memories or clear all memory.</p>
<p>Just like your web browser, ChatGPT remembers everything you previously entered. But you can also manage this information. Under “Settings” &gt; “General,” you can view all previous chat records and delete them individually. You can also use a red button to delete all records at once.</p>
<p><img src="https://adx-static.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/img/202407271907309.jpeg" alt></p>
<p><strong>Is It Worth Upgrading to ChatGPT Plus</strong></p>
<p>If you are just starting to use ChatGPT, the free version should be sufficient. However, if you are already proficient in using ChatGPT, then a subscription service might be more suitable for you.</p>
<p>The Plus subscription costs $20 per month. With the upgrade, you can use the more powerful ChatGPT model GPT-4, as well as continue to use the standard GPT-3.5.</p>
<p>GPT-4 is more powerful but has a longer response time and a limit of 50 uses per 3 hours, which might not be ideal for frequent users.</p>
<p>Plus subscribers can also create images directly within the ChatGPT environment using DALL-E 3.</p>
<p>Perhaps the appeal of ChatGPT Plus is the ability to use custom GPTs. With Plus, you can access the ChatGPT Store and hundreds of GPTs created for specific tasks.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use the ChatGPT GPT Store</strong></p>
<p>The ChatGPT Store is a relatively new feature for ChatGPT Plus users, offering many practical GPTs to enhance your experience with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>If you find using prompts difficult or want to make the most of ChatGPT’s capabilities but don’t know how, visiting this store could be very helpful.</p>
<p>For example, Logo Creator allows you to generate logos directly from ChatGPT in seconds. GPT Consensus is one of the popular GPTs, capable of searching over 200 million academic papers and providing relatively accurate references.</p>
<p><img src="https://adx-static.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/img/202407271907315.jpeg" alt></p>
<p>Using GPTs from the ChatGPT Store is as simple as clicking on the app you like and starting to use it. You can also use the search function to narrow down what you’re looking for and check the star ratings—some GPTs are clearly better than others, and higher ratings can help you find GPTs truly worth your time.</p>
<p>Depending on your level of use with ChatGPT, you can even create and sell your own GPTs on the platform.</p>
