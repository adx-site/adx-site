<p>Today, Ajiu will discuss how to utilize ChatGPT, this powerful tool for literature reviews, enabling beginners to quickly grasp the essence of literature reviews.</p>
<p>Regarding how to use ChatGPT for literature reviews, I have summarized a 4+1 model, which consists of 4 core steps and 1 important tip. This model has been repeatedly verified after guiding dozens of graduate students to complete literature reviews. When you share with your classmates or friends, you can use this 4+1 model, which is simple, easy to remember, practical, and efficient.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>What are the four core steps?</p>
<p>First: Collect and organize relevant literature.</p>
<p>Second: Extract key information from each paper.</p>
<p>Third: Use ChatGPT to summarize themes and generate the first draft.</p>
<p>Fourth: Manually review and refine the review content.</p>
<p>Why should you first collect and organize relevant literature?</p>
<p><img src="https://adx-static.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/img/202407272019912.png" alt></p>
<p>There are two reasons: Firstly, this ensures that you grasp the full scope of the research field; secondly, having a sufficient literature foundation allows ChatGPT to better understand and synthesize information.</p>
<p>Many people don’t understand this and always want the AI to directly generate the review. This approach may not only miss important literature but also lead to a partial or incorrect review.</p>
<p>The key to a literature review is to comprehensively understand the current state of research, not to expect the AI to create something out of nothing.</p>
<p>After collecting the literature, we need to extract the key information from each paper.</p>
<p>Specifically, this means summarizing the research questions, methods, results, and conclusions of each paper. This step can be made more efficient with the help of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>How to efficiently extract literature information? I have summarized a 3-step rule.</p>
<p>Step one: Input the paper abstracts into ChatGPT and ask it to extract the key information.</p>
<p>Step two: Read ChatGPT’s summary and check its accuracy against the original text.</p>
<p>Step three: If necessary, ask ChatGPT to further explain or supplement specific content.</p>
<p><img src="https://adx-static.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/img/202407272019913.png" alt></p>
<p>At this point, Ajiu can’t help but think of a master’s student’s experience. She initially felt confused about how to extract key information while doing a literature review. Later, by following this method, she completed the information extraction of 30 core papers in less than a week, greatly improving efficiency.</p>
<p>So, why use ChatGPT to summarize themes and generate the first draft?</p>
<p>Ajiu’s PhD student, Xiao Li, discovered during his first attempt that ChatGPT not only quickly identified common themes in the literature but also generated a clearly structured first draft. This saved him a lot of time in organizing and writing, allowing him to focus more on in-depth analysis and critical thinking.</p>
<p>In fact, AI has unique advantages in summarizing and organizing information. It can quickly process large amounts of information, identify key themes and research trends, providing us with a valuable starting point.</p>
<p>Remember, if the first draft generated is not ideal, don’t be discouraged. Input your specific requirements and additional information again, and you often get results that better meet your expectations.</p>
<p>The last core step is manually reviewing and refining the review content.</p>
<p>Why is this step so important? Because although ChatGPT can generate a good first draft, it may miss some details or misunderstand certain professional concepts. Manual review ensures the accuracy and depth of the review.</p>
<p><img src="https://adx-static.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/img/202407272019914.png" alt></p>
<p>For example, a student previously found that ChatGPT missed an emerging research direction during the review. By adding this part, his review became more comprehensive and cutting-edge.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s talk about that important tip: maintain critical thinking.</p>
<p>When using ChatGPT for literature reviews, we must always keep independent thinking. AI can help us organize information, but evaluating literature, identifying research gaps, and proposing new insights all require your professional skills and innovative thinking.</p>
